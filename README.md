## 🚨 The Problem

### Current State of Genetic Analysis:

Every day, millions of people undergo genetic testing, but interpreting DNA mutations remains one of medicine's biggest challenges:

- **⏰ Time Delays:** Current variant interpretation takes 2-4 weeks
- **💰 High Costs:** Expert analysis costs $200-500 per variant
- **🌍 Limited Access:** Advanced genomics restricted to major medical centers
- **❓ Uncertain Results:** 40-50% of variants classified as "Uncertain Significance"
- **🔄 Inconsistent Classifications:** Different labs often provide conflicting interpretations

### Real-World Impact:

```
A single nucleotide change: A → T
Location: BRCA1 gene, chromosome 17
Result: 85% increased breast cancer risk
Current wait time: 14-28 days
Our solution: <30 seconds
```

This delay can be life-threatening for patients needing immediate treatment decisions.

#### 🔬 How It Works

1. **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses Evo2 large language model(LLM) trained on millions of genomic sequences
2. **Real-Time Predictions:** GPU-accelerated inference delivers results in <30 seconds
3. **Clinical Validation:** Side-by-side comparison with ClinVar database annotations
4. **Global Accessibility:** Serverless deployment eliminates infrastructure barriers
5. **Evidence-Based Reports:** Downloadable PDF reports for medical records

#### 🎯 Key Innovation

Unlike traditional tools that rely on conservation scores or statistical models, our platform uses **Evo2**, a breakthrough language model(LLM) that "reads" DNA sequences like natural language, understanding complex genomic patterns and regulatory elements.
